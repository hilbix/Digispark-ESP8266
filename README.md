# Digispark-ESP8266

This is a copy of some files from http://arduino.esp8266.com/ which are found in http://digistump.com/package_digistump_index.json

These binaries neither contain a licence file nor any information about the source code used.
But they seem to stem from GPL v2 sources, so I think they can be distributed freely.

I tried to link the source as sub-project "source", but I am not sure I got it right, to satisfy GPL.  Sorry if I failed.
